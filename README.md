# Bash Scripts

* In my setup I assume this repo lives `~/Documents/scripts`.
* Compatability is only assured for an up-to date bash (version >= 5).

* My `.bashrc` calls into this repo on a regular basis.
  - `bin/` directories are exposed on my PATH.
  - `source-me` directories are sourced in my `.bashrc`.
  - Anything kubernetes related lives in `kubernetes`.
